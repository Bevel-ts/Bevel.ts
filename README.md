# Bevel.ts 🚀 🦫 

### The Precision-Driven, AI-Native Backend Framework — Now Supercharged with **Bun**

Bevel.ts is a **blazing-fast**, **type-safe**, **intent-based** backend framework built for developers who crave **elegance**, **clarity**, and **raw execution speed**.

Inspired by the architectural term **bevel** — a precise, refined edge — Bevel.ts helps you **carve structured APIs** with deliberate intent. And now, powered by **Bun**, it operates at **galactic velocity**.

With its mascot, the sharp-minded **BevelBeaver**  🦫 , this framework stands for **clarity in code**, **strength in structure**, and now — **quantum-grade speed in runtime.**

## ✨ What's New: **Now Powered by Bun**

* 🚀 **Zero-latency startup** — Cold starts are obsolete
* 🔁 **Hot reload built-in** — No chokidar needed
* 📦 **Single binary workflow** with `bunx bevel`
* 🧠 **Bun-native watch mode** for frictionless DX
* 🌐 **Edge-native ready** for Vercel, Cloudflare, and local Bun servers

> From **fast** to **instant**. Bevel.ts with Bun isn't just an upgrade — it's a **dimensional shift**.

## 🧠 Intent Over Implementation

Forget REST. Forget GraphQL. Define the **what**, not the **how**:

```ts
defineIntent("user.login", z.object({
  email: z.string(),
  password: z.string()
}), async (ctx) => {
  // login logic
});
```
